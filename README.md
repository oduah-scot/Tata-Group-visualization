Empowering Business with Effective Insight 
Project details steps taken to analyse Let me begin by reviewing and cleaning the dataset based on the following criteria:Ensure that the quantity is not below 1 unit.
Ensure that the unit price is not below $0. The dataset has been cleaned, with 531,283 rows remaining. We removed any records where the quantity was less than 1 or the unit price was below 0. Once i'm done this, i can import the cleaned data into Power BI to create the required visuals. To create a time series visualization of revenue data for 2011, with monthly granularity in Power BI, follow these steps: Load the cleaned data (as per the previous instructions). Create a New Measure for Revenue. Go to the Data view. Select the table with your imported data. In the top ribbon, click on "New Measure" and create a measure for Revenue by multiplying the Quantity and Unit Price. ilter Data for the Year 2011. Create a new Report page. In the Visualizations pane, drag the InvoiceDate column into the "Filters on this page" area.Set a filter for the InvoiceDate to show only data from 2011: In the filter, choose "Advanced filtering" and select the range from 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2011.
Create a Bar Chart for the Top 10 Countries by Revenue by Drag your Revenue measure into the Values section, Select Top N and set it to show the Top 10 by Revenue add Quantity Sold.

Merge all datasets into one excel sheet. Group columns according to common columns. Cleane data by removing rows that have values which are missing, changing the data type of some values within a column, and removing columns which are not relevant to this task. Model data by using "vlookup" and "sum if" to define relationships. <br/>
