Empowering Business with Effective Insight 
Project details steps taken to analyse Let me begin by reviewing and cleaning the dataset based on the following criteria:Ensure that the quantity is not below 1 unit.
Ensure that the unit price is not below $0. The dataset has been cleaned, with 530,693 rows remaining. We removed any records where the quantity was less than 1 or the unit price was below 0. Once i'm done this, i can import the cleaned data into Power BI to create the required visuals. To create a time series visualization of revenue data for 2011, with monthly granularity in Power BI, follow these steps: Load the cleaned data (as per the previous instructions). Create a New Measure for Revenue. Go to the Data view. Select the table with your imported data. In the top ribbon, click on "New Measure" and create a measure for Revenue by multiplying the Quantity and Unit Price. ilter Data for the Year 2011. Create a new Report page. In the Visualizations pane, drag the InvoiceDate column into the "Filters on this page" area.Set a filter for the InvoiceDate to show only data from 2011: In the filter, choose "Advanced filtering" and select the range from 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2011.

To create a time series visualization of revenue data for 2011, with monthly granularity in Power BI, Step-by-Step Guide:  Filter Data for the Year 2011
Create a new Report page. In the Visualizations pane, drag the InvoiceDate column into the "Filters on this page" area. Set a filter for the InvoiceDate to show only data from 2011: In the filter, choose "Advanced filtering" and select the range from 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2011. Step 4: Create a Time Series Line Chart Drag InvoiceDate into the Axis section of the canvas. Drag your newly created Revenue measure into the Values section. select the Line Chart option. In the InvoiceDate column, ensure the date granularity is set to Month. Click the dropdown under InvoiceDate (in the "Axis" field) and select Month to show monthly granularity. Step 5: Format the Visual.
Labels: Ensure data labels are visible to easily see monthly revenue values.Axis: Format the X-axis to display months properly (e.g., Jan, Feb, etc.).

To create a visual showing the top 10 customers by revenue, with the highest revenue-generating customer at the start and gradually decreasing, we will use a sorted bar chart in Power BI. Here's a step-by-step: Ensure the Revenue Measure is Created. In the Report view, drag the CustomerID column into the Axis section of the visual canvas. Drag the Revenue measure into the Values section. create a bar chart showing revenue by customer.use the Filters pane: Click on the drop-down next to CustomerID in the "Filters on this visual" section. Select Top N and set it to display the Top 10 by Revenue. Drag the Revenue measure into the By Value field. Click Apply filter Ensure the bar chart is sorted in descending order (highest to lowest revenue): Click on the three-dot menu (ellipsis) on the top-right of the chart. Choose Sort by Revenue. Make sure Sort descending is selected to show the highest revenue at the top and gradually decrease.
